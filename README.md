# Earthquake Challenge

## Proyect Overview

The objective of this project is to gather earthquake GeoJSON data from the USGS API, create and explore interactive maps of earthquakes around the world.
The earthquake data is represented on the maps in relation to the tectonic platesâ€™ location on the earth, and according to each event's magnitude.

## Resourses 

Data Source: Earthquakes GeoJSON, Earthquakes above 4.5mag GeoJSON, Tectonic Plate GeoJSON
Software: HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Visual Studio Code 1.49.1, Leaflet 1.7.1, D3.js 6.2.0
